# Wordpress Pseudo Theme
## _Training wheels for writing your own wordpress theme_
Wordpress Pseudo Code files that tell you what to do, but not how to do it.

`cd local/wordpress/wp-content/themes/`
1. Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/K-JAX/webpack-pseudo-helper.git`
1. Start coding on any of the files! 
[OPTIONAL] If you prefer to follow an instructed series of steps, follow my personally preferred sequence of coding below. _Just my workflow, feel free to disagree and jump around to your heart's content_ ;)

## Why Pseudo Theme?
I believe that a developer is much more effective and can get on to more important things if they can commit things they commonly re-reference daily to muscle memory.

The files in this repository are meant to be an exercise for you to build your own entire theme based on loosely given instruction in the form of comments in each file.

## How & When to use Pseudo Theme?
Of course, from pseudo code, we cannot build the perfect theme that handles all hyper-specific use cases. Instead this is inspired by wordpress default twenty-nineteen theme to set you up with a basic blog theme. This goes just a bit beyond that with start customizations for custom post types, meta boxes, and gutenberg blocks, should you need to create them.
So if you're wondering which projects you should consider using the Pseudo Theme for, ask yourself these questions?
1. **Do I constantly need a refresher on even the most basic wordpress functions that are used ALL THE TIME?**
1. **Do I feel like I'm doing myself a disservice by using starter themes that do all of the technical work for me and not understanding basic building blocks of a WP theme?**
1. **Do I want to increase my theme building speed?**
1. **Do I want to have a routine exercise of adding certain parts to a functioning theme?**

## My (Kevin/K-JAX's) list of to-dos
- [x] start repository and instructions
- [ ] add submodule git pseudo projects to this theme
- [ ] finish the basic theme files pseudo code
- [ ] Add instruction to going to individual submodules if only a specific feature needs to be added for user's own local wordpress theme
